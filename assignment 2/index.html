    <h1>1984 by George Orwell</h1>
    <h2>Uzochikamma Ifemenam</h2>

    <p>The text I chose for my data visualizations is "1984" by George Orwell. This classic dystopian novel depicts a totalitarian society ruled by the Party, led by the enigmatic figure Big Brother. The protagonist, Winston Smith, rebels against the oppressive regime, ultimately grappling with themes of surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of individuality. To interact with this visualization, you can toggle the visibility of spheres representing one of three main characters (e.g., "Winston", "Brother" and "Goldstein") using the checkboxes provided in the UI. Additionally, you can enable the "Rotate Camera" option in the UI to observe the scene from different angles.</p>

    <p>In this visualization, each sphere represents an occurrence of a main character within the text. The height of the sphere corresponds to its location in the text, with spheres positioned lower representing earlier occurrences and those positioned higher representing later occurrences. This spatial arrangement visually communicates the distribution of the characters throughout the text.</p>

    <p>The camera rotation introduces dynamic movement to the scene, symbolizing Winston's struggle against the static, oppressive regime. As the camera rotates, it metaphorically explores different perspectives, echoing Winston's quest for truth and individuality amidst a society dictated by conformity. The animations, including sphere rotation and shaking, reflect the themes of instability and unpredictability inherent in the dystopian world of "1984". The constant motion suggests the precarious nature of truth and reality, mirroring Winston's turbulent journey as he navigates a world of manipulation and deception.</p>

    <p>The lighting in the scene also contributes to the thematic exploration. The ambient light represents the pervasive surveillance and control exerted by the Party on others, while the directional light symbolizes the elusive authority of Big Brother. The choice of red, yellow, and blue for sphere colours alludes to the Party's propaganda and manipulation of information, reinforcing the narrative's themes of surveillance and indoctrination.</p>

    <p>The concentration and distribution of spheres representing key terms offer insights into the text's narrative structure of these complex characters. For example, a high density of spheres clustered around certain sections may highlight pivotal moments or reoccurrences of the characters within the novel. In addition, observing the interactions between spheres and their dynamic animations can provide insights into the evolving dynamics between these characters in the text. For instance, the erratic movements of spheres signify moments of tension, conflict, or subversion within the narrative.</p>

    <p>The the two visualizations differ substantially:</p>

    <p>The first visualization focuses on the main characters, represented by spheres. Each sphere corresponds to a character-related term from the text, such as "Winston," "brother," and "Goldstein." By using spheres to represent characters, the visualization emphasizes the depth and lifelikeness of characters in driving the plot and exploring themes such as rebellion, loyalty, and betrayal. On the other hand, the second visulaization below, focusing on significant objects in the novel, uses ellipsoids to represent these objects. Each ellipsoid corresponds to a specific term from the text, such as "telescreen," "gin," and "hate." This approach highlights the importance of these objects in shaping the narrative and themes of "1984." Objects like the telescreen, representing surveillance, and the gin, representing control and manipulation, are central to the dystopian world depicted in the novel.  In the Two Minutes Hate scene, the telescreen serves as a central object of control and surveillance. It broadcasts propaganda and incites emotions of hatred and loyalty towards the Party.</p> 
    
    <p>In the visualization, the presence of the telescreen can be represented by multiple ellipsoids scattered throughout the scene. These ellipsoids symbolize the omnipresent nature of surveillance and propaganda in the dystopian society of "1984." The ellipsoids associated with the telescreen could be clustered around a central point in the scene, indicating the focal point of attention and influence during the Two Minutes Hate. </p>

    <p>Another substantial difference is lighting. the first visualization introduces dynamic lighting effects through coloured point lights that change position over time. This dynamic lighting, along with the rotation and shaking animation applied to the spheres representing characters, symbolizes the complexity of the characters’ relationships with one another, and power dynamics with the red light symbolizing Big Brother’s constant surveillance. The changing positions of the lights represent the ever-present tension between characters. Conversely, the second visualization is static, with ambient and directional lights providing general illumination to the scene. This lighting setup symbolizes the setting for the mood these objects create in the text. They serve as a reminder of the reinforcement of oppression.</p>

    <p>The last difference is the interactions and themes. The first visualization emphasizes character interactions and dynamics, reflecting themes of rebellion, conformity, and manipulation present in the novel given the reason behind the constant shaking of the spheres. The animated movement of the spheres and dynamic lighting effects suggest the complex relationships, struggles, and internal conflicts faced by the characters as they navigate the dystopian society of "1984." In contrast, the second visualization, focusing on significant objects, highlights themes related to surveillance, control, and oppression. By visually representing these objects and their occurrences in the text, the visualization underscores their importance in shaping the characters' experiences and the overall narrative. The animations also differ as we see the ellipses from different angles as they spin when the control is toggled. </p>

    <div class="canvas-container">
        <h2>Significant Objects in 1984</h2>
        <canvas class="webgl2"></canvas>
        <div id="parent2"></div>
        <p>Left click and drag to rotate. Right click and drag to move. Scroll to zoom.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The second visualization created using Three.js and also text data from George Orwell's "1984" offers a visually engaging representation of significant objects from the text which are the telescreen, gin and the two-minute hate. To interact with the visualization, users can utilize the provided UI controls. These controls allow them to toggle the visibility of ellipsoids representing different terms, initiate rotation of the camera, and enable the spinning of the ellipsoids for enhanced dynamism. Additionally, users can observe the ellipsoids' positions and rotations, providing a dynamic representation of the textual data.</p>

    <p>The visualization translates information from the text into visual form by assigning ellipsoids of varying colours and sizes to represent objects. The spatial arrangement of these ellipsoids within the 3D scene reflects their occurrences and positions within the narrative. For instance, more prominent objects may be represented by larger or more numerous ellipsoids, while less significant other terms may have smaller or fewer representations. The emotion of hate, manipulated and directed by the Party, is also a key theme. It serves as a tool for maintaining control over the population and fostering unity through fear and aggression. In this visualization, occurrences of the term "hate" in the text could be represented by specific ellipsoids that emit a darker hue or pulsate with intensity, symbolizing the emotional manipulation and propaganda broadcasted by the telescreen. These ellipsoids are positioned strategically around the scene, evoking a sense of tension and agitation among the other objects and characters present. </p>

    <p>Through the visualization, two insights into the text can be gleaned. Firstly, the distribution of terms across the narrative becomes visually apparent. By observing the spatial arrangement of ellipsoids, it can be discerned that patterns and clusters of occurrences, indicating thematic or narrative significance and their impact on the characters. Secondly, the prominence of the objects relative to others can be inferred. The objects represented by larger or more numerous ellipsoids hold greater importance and impact within the text, highlighting their key themes or motifs.</p>

    <p>While the visualization provides valuable insights into the textual data, there are areas I could have improved on. I had hoped to change the position of the scene to be vertical but I was unable to achieve that, so I stuck with the vertical visualization. I had also thought of making the second visualization more dynamic by making the ellipsoids morph into spheres to show more of a connection between the objects and the characters. I am however very happy with the uniqueness of the lighting in the first visualization. In the future, I hope to find more creative ways to visualize my texts and be more experimental with what I can do with Three.js Overall, my continual refinement and innovation in data visualization techniques have the potential to be more comprehensive and immersive. </p>
